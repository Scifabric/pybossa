# What is PYBOSSA?

PYBOSSA is a technology built by [Scifabric](https://scifabric.com), for crowdsourcing or citizen science platforms.

PYBOSSA is an extremely flexible and versatile technology with a multitude of applications that
adapt to each specific case facilitating many of the daily tasks that take place in research
environments such as museums, art galleries, heritage institutions, libraries of any kind, market
research companies, hospitals, universities and all those organisations that manage data or require
information from their customers/users -such as airports, shopping malls, banks, hotel chains, etc.

PYBOSSA‚Äôs simplicity consists in its easy adjustment to any areas using any of the available
templates, this way every customer can then adapt it to their own needs.

PYBOSSA integrates with other data collection products such as Amazon S3, Twitter, Youtube,
Google Spreadsheets, Flickr, Raspberry Pi, etc. Through all these integrations
PYBOSSA allows data capture for further analysis made by users in a transparent and easy way.

# PYBOSSA for python 3

We've finally migrated PYBOSSA to python 3. We're not going to merge into master until we test it in production a bit
more, so please, help us by testing it. All you have to do is basically, check out the python3 branch (migrate-python3) and run
it. Then, any bug, issue you find, you just report it and we will be happy to help you.

PYBOSSA was inspired by the [BOSSA](http://bossa.berkeley.edu/) crowdsourcing engine but is written in
python (hence the name!). It can be used for any distributed tasks project
but was initially developed to help scientists and other researchers
crowd-source human problem-solving skills!
