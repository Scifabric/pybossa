# What is PYBOSSA?

PYBOSSA is our technology, used for the development of platforms and data collection
within collaborative environments, analysis and data enrichment.

PYBOSSA is an extremely flexible and versatile technology with a multitude of applications that
adapt to each specific case facilitating many of the daily tasks that take place in research
environments such as museums, art galleries, heritage institutions, libraries of any kind, market
research companies, hospitals, universities and all those organisations that manage data or require
information from their customers/users -such as airports, shopping malls, banks, hotel chains, etc.

PYBOSSA’s simplicity consists in its easy adjustment to any areas using any of the available
templates, this way every customer can then adapt it to their own needs.

PYBOSSA integrates with other data collection products such as Amazon S3, Twitter, Youtube,
Google Spreadsheets, Flickr, Raspberry Pi, etc. Through all these integrations
PYBOSSA allows data capture for further analysis made by users in a transparent and easy way.

PYBOSSA was inspired by the [BOSSA](http://bossa.berkeley.edu/) crowdsourcing engine but is written in
python (hence the name!). It can be used for any distributed tasks project
but was initially developed to help scientists and other researchers
crowd-source human problem-solving skills!
