Participating in the project
============================
So you have decided that this project is interesting and you want to help us: **THANKS!**

If you want to help us you can do it by:

 * Proposing new features in the `Issues page <https://github.com/PyBossa/pybossa/issues>`_,
 * Submitting new bugs/issues in the `Issues page <https://github.com/PyBossa/pybossa/issues>`_, or
 * Fixing bugs and sending us actual code patches.

The project is using the popular `Github Workflow 
<http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html>`_. 
The basic ideas of this work flow are the following:

 * The master branch is always deployable, so never ever code there!
 * Create a branch with a meaningful name and work on it as much as you want.
 * When you are ready, issue a git pull request and we will merge it.

Please, read carefully the Github workflow and let us know if need help collaborating with us.
