===============================
Quickstart: Creating a Project
===============================

This is a short guide about how you can create a project in a PyBossa
server. Readers may wish to start with the :doc:`Step by step tutorial on creating an
Project <tutorial>` which walks through creating a
simple photo classification project if they want to understand all the
details about how you create a project.

First of all we have to create a project for the project. A project
represents a set of tasks that have to be resolved by people, so a project
will have the following items:

#. **Name**,
#. **Short name** or **slug**, and
#. **Description**

The **slug** or **short name** is a shortcut for accessing the project via
the web (short urls like this http://domain.com/project/slug).

The **description** is a short sentence that will be used to describe your
project (think about it like a Tweet long description).

A project can be created using two different methods:

* :ref:`web-interface`, or
* :ref:`api-interface`.


.. _web-interface:

Using the Web Interface
=======================

Creating a project using the web interface involves four steps:

1. Creating the project,
2. Import the tasks using the *simple built-in* :ref:`task-creator` 
   (uploading a CSV file or Google Spreadsheet link exported
   as CSV),
3. Write the :ref:`task-presenter` for the users, and
4. Publish the project.

Creating the project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to create a project in PyBossa via the web interface you have to:

1. Create a local account in your PyBossa server: 

|

.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/MMnUQr7.png
   :alt: PyBossa Register 
   :width: 100%

|

Another alternative is to use your Twitter, Facebook and Google sign in methods, (if
the server has enabled them, see the documentation: :ref:`ssnn`).


|

.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/GxhfjGL.png
    :alt: PyBossa sign in methods

|

2. Once you have an account, click in **create** link of the top bar.
3. After clicking in the previous button, you will have to fill in a form
   with the very basic to create your project:

   #. **Name**: the full name of your project, i.e. *Flickr Person
      Finder*.
   #. **Short Name**: the *slug* or short name used in the URL for
      accessing your project, i.e. *flickrperson*.
   #. **Long Description**: A *long* description where you can use Markdown
      to format the description of your project. This field is
      usually used to provide information about the project, the
      developer, the researcher group or institutions involved in the
      project, etc.

| 

.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/Js4YgVg.png
    :alt: PyBossa Create link
|

.. note::
    PyBossa usually provides two Categories by default: *thinking* and
    *sensing*. The *thinking* category represents the standard PyBossa
    project where users contribute helping with their skills. *Sensing*
    category refers to projects that are using a volunter sensing tools like
    EpiCollect or Raspberry Pi with PYBOSSA for gathering data.

|

4. Once you have filled all the fields, click in the **Create the
   project** button, and you will have created your first project.

|

After creating the project, you should be redirected to the
**Settings** project page, where you will be able to customize your project by
adding some extra information or changing some settings. There, you will find a
form with the same fields as in the previous step (just in case you've changed
your mind and wanted to change any of them) plus the following:

* **Description**: A **short** description of the project, e.g.
  *A project to classify cancer cells*. By default, it will have been autogenerated
  for you from the **Long description** you filled in the previous step
  (but without the Markdown!).
* **Allow Anonymous Contributors**: By default anonymous and
  authenticated users can participate in all the projects, however
  you can change it to only allow authenticated volunteers to
  participate.
* **Password**: If you want to control who can contribute or access to your
  project, you can set a password here to share with those you allow to do it.
  If you leave it blank, then no password will protect your project.
* **Category**: Select a category that fits your project.
  :ref:`categories`
  are added and managed by the server :ref:`administrators`.
* In addition, you will be able to select and upload an **image** from your
  local computer to set it as the project image thoroughout the server.

.. _csv-import:

Importing the tasks via the built-in CSV Task Importer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tasks can be imported from a CSV file or a Google Spreadsheet via the simple
built-in :ref:`task-creator`. You have to do the following:

1. Navigate to your project's page (you can directly access it using 
   the *slug* project name: http://server/project/slug).
2. Click in the **Tasks** section -on the left side local navigation menu:

|
.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/nauht7l.png
   :width: 100%
|

3. And click again on the **Import Tasks** card. After clicking on it you will
   see several options. The first ones are for using the different kinds of
   importers supported by PyBossa: Amazon S3, Twitter, Dropbox, Flickr, Youtube,
   Google Spreadsheet, CSV url, and EpiCollect Plus.
|
.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/eWBxSyS.png
   :width: 100%
|
For example, the Flickr importer will allow to import a Flickr album by typing its
ID or if you have an account, by logging into Flickr and showing your own public (and 
creative commons licensed) albums:

|
.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/lF9LJVO.jpg
   :width: 100%
|

Select one of the albums, click import and all the pictures will be imported as tasks
for your PYBOSSA project. As simple as that.

The other importers are very similar. In most cases you'll provide a URL to the resource, 
like for the CSV and Google Spreadhseet importer, while the Dropbox, Amazon S3, Twitter, Youtube,
and EpiCollect Plus importers will have a nice interface to importa data automagically for you.

.. note::

   If you're trying to import from a Google Spreadsheet, ensure the file is
   accessible to everyone via the Share option, choosing: "Public on the web - 
   Anyone on the Internet can find and view"

.. note::

   Your spreadsheet/CSV file must contain a header row. All the fields in the
   CSV will be serialized to JSON and stored in the **info** field. If
   your field name is one of **state**, **quorum**, **calibration**,
   **priority_0**, or **n_answers**, it will be saved in the respective
   columns. Your spreadsheet must be visible to public or everyone with URL.


In the Task Importer section, you'll find also other pre-loaded with Google Spreadsheets URLs.
Those templates are examples that you can use to learn how to create your own spreadsheets and
import data for image, sound, video, pdf mining and mapping projects. 

|
.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/eGwKDpB.png
|

By using these templates, you'll be able to learn the structure of the tasks,
and directly re-use the :ref:`task-presenter` templates that know the structure
(name of the columns) for presenting the task. 

Additionally, you can re-use the templates by downloading the CSV files from
Google Docs, or even copying them to your own Google Drive account (click in
*File* -> *Make a copy* in the Google Doc Spreadsheet). The
available templates are the following:

* `Image Pattern Recognition`_
* `Sound Pattern Recognition`_
* `Video Pattern Recognition`_
* `Geo-coding`_ and
* `PDF transcription`_. 

.. note::
    If you import again the same URL, only new records will be added to the
    project.

.. _epicollect-import:

Importing the tasks from an EpiCollect Plus Public Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EpiCollect_ provides a web project for the generation of forms and freely hosted
project websites (using Google's AppEngine) for many kinds of mobile data 
collection projects.

Data can be collected using multiple mobile phones running either the Android 
Operating system or the iPhone (using the EpiCollect mobile app) and all data can 
be synchronised from the phones and viewed centrally (using Google Maps) via the 
Project website or directly on the phones.

EpiCollect_ can help you to recollect data samples according to a form that
could include multimedia like photos. Moreover, EpiCollect_ can geolocate the data 
sample as it supports the built-in GPS that all modern smartphones have. 

For example, you can create
an EpiCollect_ project where the form will ask the user to take a picture of
a lake, geo-locate it automatically via the smartphone built-in GPS and upload
the picture to the EpiCollect_ server. If the user does not have Internet
access at that moment, the user will be able to synchronize the data afterwards
i.e. when the user has access to an Internet WIFI hotspot.

PyBossa can automatically import data from a public EpiCollect_ Plus project
that you own or that it is publicly available in the EpiCollect_ web site and
help you to validate, analyze, etc. the data that have been obtained via
EpiCollect.

If you want to import the data points submitted to a **public** EpiCollect_
project, you will have to follow the next steps:

1. Navigate to your project's page (you can directly access it using 
   the *slug* project name: http://server/project/slug).
2. Click in the **Tasks** section -on the left side local navigation menu:
3. And click on the **Import Tasks** 
   button. After clicking on it you will see several different options:
4. Click in the **Use an EpiCollect Project** one.
|

.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/A50La7O.png

|
5. Then, type the **name of the EpiCollect project** and the name of the
   **form** that you want to import, and click in the import button.


All the data points should be imported now in your project.

.. _`EpiCollect`: http://plus.epicollect.net

.. note::
    EpiCollect projects will be gathering data mostly all the time, for this
    reason, if you import again the same EpiCollect project, only **new data
    points** will be imported. This feature will allow you to easily add new data
    points to the PyBossa project without having to do anything special.

.. _flickr-import:

Importing the tasks from a Flickr photo set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyBossa also allows to import tasks for projects based on images (like image
pattern recognition ones) directly from a Flickr_ `set <https://www.flickr.com/help/photos/#150321191>`_
(also called album).

When importing tasks from a Flickr set, a new task will be created for each of
the photos in the specified set. The tasks will include the following data about
each picture (which will be later available to be used in the task presenter):

* title: the title of the photograph, as it appears on Flickr.
* url: the url to the raw .jpg image, in its original size.
* url_b: the url to the image, 'big sized.
* url_m: the url to the image, 'medium' sized.
* link: a link to the photo page in flickr (not to the raw image).

You can import tasks from a Flickr photo set (a.k.a. album) in either of the
following ways:

The easiest one is to give the PyBossa server permission to access your Flickr
list of albums. To do so, you'll have to log in to your Flickr account by clicking
the "Log in Flickr" button. Then you'll be redirected to Flickr, where you will
be asked if you want to allow PyBossa to access your Flickr information. If you
say yes, then you'll be again redirected to PyBossa and you'll see all of your
albums. Choose one of them and then click the "Import" button to get all the
photos created as tasks for your project.

.. note::
    Next time you try to import photos using the Flickr importer, you'll see
    the albums for your account again. If you don't want PyBossa to access them
    anymore, or just want to use another Flickr account, then click "Revoke access".

Another option to import from a Flickr album is by specifying the ID of the set
(album) directly. This option is a bit more advanced (don't be afraid, it is still
very easy if you follow the next steps) and it allows you to import from a photo
set that you don't own (although, it will have to be public. Also check the rights
of the photos on it!). Another advantage is that you don't need to log in to
Flickr, sou you don't even need to have a Flickr account.

These are the steps:

1. Navigate to your project's page and click in the **Tasks** section:
2. Then click on the **Import Tasks** button, and select the **Flickr importer**:
3. Log in with your Flickr ID and select one of the available albums of your account,
   or type the ID of the Flickr set you want to import the photos from, then click
   on the import button:

|
.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/UZRBj8y.png
   :width: 100%
|

If you cannot find the ID or don't know what it is, just browse to your Flickr
photo set and check the URL. Can you see that last long number rigth at the end
of it? That's what you're looking for!

|
.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/h6qNDX2.png
   :width: 100%

|

And all the photos will be imported to your project. Just like with the other
importers, each task will be created only once, even if you import twice from the
same Flickr set (unless you add new photos to it, of course!).

.. note::
    You will need to make sure that every photo belonging to the set has the
    visibility set to public, so the PyBossa server can then access and present
    them to the volunteers of your project.

.. _`Flickr`: https://www.flickr.com/

Importing the tasks from a Dropbox account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can import tasks from arbitrary data hosted on a Dropbox account with the
Dropbox importer. When importer tasks like this, the following information will
be added to the info field of each tasks, available later to be used in the task
presenter of the project:

* filename: just it, the name of the file you're importing as a task.
* link: the link to the Dropbox page showing the file.
* link_raw: the link to the raw file served by Dropbox. This is the one you'll have to use if you want to direct link to the file from the presenter (e.g. for using an image in a <img> tag, you'd do: <img src=task.info.link_raw>).

In addition to this generic information, the Dropbox importer will also recognize
some kind of files by their extension and will attach some extra information to
them.

For pdf files (.pdf extension), the following field will be obtained too:

* pdf_url: direct link to the raw pdf file, with CORS support.

For image files (.png, jpg, .jpeg and .gif extensions) the following data will be
available:

* url_m: the same as link_raw
* url_b: the same as link_raw
* title: the same as filename

For audio files (.mp4, .m4a, .mp3, .ogg, .oga, .webm and .wav extensions):

* audio_url: raw link to the audio file, which can be used inside an HTML 5 <audio> tag and supports CORS.

For video files (.mp4, .m4v, .ogg, .ogv, .webm and .avi extensions):

* audio_url: raw link to the video file, which can be used inside an HTML 5 <video> tag and supports CORS.

The tasks created with the Dropbox importer are ready to be used with the template
project presenters available in PyBossa, as they include the described fields.

Thus, importing your images from Dropbox will allow you to immediately use the
image pattern recognition template with them; importing videos, audio files or
pdfs with the Dropbox importer will also grant you to use the presenter templates
for video pattern recognition, sound pattern recognition or documents transcription,
respectively, with no additional modifications and have them working right away
(as long as the files have any of the mentioned file extensions, of course).

These are the steps:

1. Navigate to your project's page and click in the **Tasks** section:
2. Then click on the **Import Tasks** button, and select the **Dropbox importer**:
3. Click on the "Choose from Dropbox" icon. You will be asked your Dropbox
account credentials. then select as many files as you want:

|
.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/dsgM0Tg.png
|

4. You can repeat step 3 as many times as you want, and more files will be added
to your import. Then, click on "Import".


.. _twitter-import:

Importing the tasks from a Twitter account or search result
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another option for importing tasks is using the built-in Twitter importer. It
allows to import tweets as tasks from either a specified Twitter user account, or
from the results returned from a search to the Twitter search API.

Tasks imported with it will have the tweet data attached to their info field,
and can later be used from within the task presenter. This data is a direct
transcription of the data returned by the Twitter API, in particular a Tweet_
object.

.. _Tweet: https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/tweets

Please notice that the values returned by the Twitter API may vary. However,
the following fields are guaranteed to be always included in the info field of
the tasks:

* created_at: the date and time the tweet was made.
* favorite_count: number of times the tweet has been marked as 'favorite'.
* retweet_count: number of times the tweet has been retweeted.
* coordinates: geographic coordinates of the place the tweet was made from. Note
  that this is not always available for every tweet.
* tweet_id: the internal ID handled by Twitter to identify this tweet.
* user: an object_ with information about the tweet author, as returned by the
  Twitter API.
* text: the actual content of the tweet.

In addition, an extra field "user_screen_name" has been added to the info field:

* user_screen_name: the screen name (or 'handle') of the author of the tweet.

.. _object: https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/users

For more information, please refer to the Twitter_ documentation.
.. _Twitter: https://dev.twitter.com/

.. note::
    **When importing tweets from a search, retweets will be ignored!**

So, to import tasks with the Twitter importer, do as follows:

1. Navigate to your project's page and click in the **Tasks** section:
2. Then click on the **Import Tasks** button, and select the **Twitter importer**:
3. You can provide your own Twitter credentials and make API requests in behalf of them, or use the credentials provided by us. (The later only allows to import the number of tweets returned by a single Twitter API call, which is 100 for searches and 200 for user timelines.) 
4. Fill in the two fields you will find in the form. The first one is for the
source of your tweets. If you want them to be imported from a user account, then
write it with the "@" symbol, like "@PyBossa". If you just want to import tweets
containing a word on them (or a #hashtag), then type it there. The second field
is for you to specify how many tweets you want to import. You can import as many
as you want!

Finally, click on the "Import" button, and you are done:

|
.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/l5PG2WX.png

|
Importing the tasks from an Amazon S3 bucket
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tasks can be imported from data hosted on the Amazon S3 service. Similarly to
the Dropbox importer, these tasks can use different kind of data, like images,
videos, audios, PDF files, etc. hosted on any S3 bucket.

The S3 importer will work pretty much the same as the Dropbox one. When using it,
the created tasks will contain the following data in the info field:

* filename: just it, the name of the file you're importing as a task.
* link: the link to the raw file served from Amazon S3.
* url: same as the above.

In addition to this generic information, the S3 importer will also recognize
some kind of files by their extension and will attach some extra information to
them.

For pdf files (.pdf extension), the following field will be obtained too:

* pdf_url: direct link to the raw pdf file.

For image files (.png, jpg, .jpeg and .gif extensions) the following data will be
available:

* url_m: the same as link.
* url_b: the same as link.
* title: the same as filename.

For audio files (.mp4, .m4a, .mp3, .ogg, .oga, .webm and .wav extensions):

* audio_url: raw link to the audio file, which can be used inside an HTML 5 <audio> tag.

For video files (.mp4, .m4v, .ogg, .ogv, .webm and .avi extensions):

* audio_url: raw link to the video file, which can be used inside an HTML 5 <video> tag.

The tasks created with the S3 importer are ready to be used with the template
project presenters available in PyBossa, as they include the described fields.

Thus, importing your images from S3 will allow you to immediately use the
image pattern recognition template with them; importing videos, audio files or
pdfs with the S3 importer will also grant you to use the presenter templates
for video pattern recognition, sound pattern recognition or documents transcription,
respectively, with no additional modifications and have them working right away
(as long as the files have any of the mentioned file extensions, of course).

Importing from an S3 bucket requires that the bucket visibility is set to *public*
so its content can be seen and listed by PyBossa. To make a bucket public, go to
your AWS management console and select the S3 service. Then select the bucket you
want to make public and click on "Properties". Click on "Add more Permissions"
and add a new one with "Grantee: Everyone" and the "List" checkbox selected,
like in the following image:

|
.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/FuN9XAS.png
|

You may also need to enable CORS in the bucket. In the same menu as above, click
on "Edit CORS Configuration" and configure it. You can learn more
`here <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html>`_.

Finally, you need to make sure that every file inside the bucket that you want to
use in a task has a *public* link too. Go to the bucket content and select the
files. Then click on "Actions" and select "Make Public". Your files will now be
visible for everyone, including a PyBossa server.

|
.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/AHBVQCk.png
|

Once your S3 bucket is ready, you can follow these steps to import tasks from it:

1. Navigate to your project's page and click in the **Tasks** section:
2. Then click on the **Import Tasks** button, and select the **S3 importer**:
3. Type the name of the bucket from which you will be importing your tasks and
click on "Search in bucket". If you followed the steps above and your bucket is
public, you will see a list of the items it contains. Select as many as you want:

|
.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/6RAMqd9.png
|

4. When you're ready, click on "Import".

Importing the tasks from Youtube
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tasks can be imported from Youtube. Currently the importer supports importing from Youtube with:

* Playlists

When importing the video the importer parses all videos information and creates tasks with info fields:

* video_url: the URL of the youtube video which can be embedded in the task form.
* oembed: embeddable code for the (old) PyBossa video templates.

The tasks created with the Youtube importer are ready to be used with the youtube and video templates.


Flushing all the tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The project settings gives you an option to automatically **delete all the
tasks and associated task runs** from your project.

.. note::
    **This action cannot be un-done, so please, be sure that you want to actually
    delete all the tasks.**

.. note::
    **This action will only allow you to delete tasks that are not associated with
    a result. When a result is created, that task and its task runs cannot be deleted
    so the volunteers can always have access to their contributions.**

If you are sure that you want to flush all the tasks and task runs for your
project, go to the project page (http://server/project/slug/tasks/) and click in
the **Settings** option of the left local navigation menu:

|
.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/nauht7l.png
    :width: 100%

|

Then, you will see that there is a sub section called: **Task Settings** and
a button with the label: **Delete the tasks**. Click in that button and a new
page will be shown:


|
.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/DKPV6dc.png
    :width:100%

|

As you can see, a **red warning alert** is shown, warning you that if you click
in the **yes** button, you will be deleting not only the project tasks, but
also the answers (task runs) that you have recollected for your project. Be
sure before proceeding that you want to delete all the tasks. After clicking in
the **yes** button, you will see that all the tasks have been flushed.

Creating the Task Presenter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have the project and the tasks in the server, you can start
working with the :ref:`task-presenter`, which will be the web project that 
will get the tasks of your project, present them to the volunteer and save the
answers provided by the users.

If you have followed all the steps described in this section, you will be
already in the page of your project, however, if you are not, you only need
to access your project URL to work with your project. If your project
*slug* or *short name* is *flickrperson* you will be able to access the
project managing options in this URL::

    http://PYBOSSA-SERVER/project/flickrperson

.. note::
    
    You need to be logged in, otherwise you will not be able to modify the
    project.

Another way for accessing your project (or projects) is clicking in
your *user name* and select the *My Projects* item from the drop down menu.
From there you will be able to manage your projects:

|

    :alt: PyBossa User Account
|

.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/9sO21Zd.png
    :width: 100%
|

Once you have chosen your project, you can add :ref:`task-presenter` by
clicking in the **Tasks** local navigation link, and then click in the 
button named **Editor** under the **Task Presenter** box. 

|
.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/nauht7l.png
    :width: 100%
|

After clicking in this button, a new web page will be shown where you can
choose a template to start coding your project, so you don't have to
actually start from scratch. 

|
.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/psC5m6Q.png

|

After choosing one of the templates, you will be able to adapt it to fit your
project needs in a web text editor.

|
.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/g9gAvWw.png
    :width: 100%
|

Click in the **Preview button** to get an idea about how it will look like your
:ref:`task-presenter`.

|
.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/DsDDBia.png
    :width: 100%
|

We recommend to read the 
:doc:`Step by step tutorial on
creating a Project <tutorial>`, as you will understand
how to create the task presenter, which is basically adding some HTML skeleton
to load the task data, input fields to get the answer of the users, and some
JavaScript to make it to work.

.. _publishing:

Publishing the project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After completing the previous three steps, your project will be almost ready.
The final step is to *publish* it, because now it will still be a draft, and it
will be hidden to everyone but you (and admins).

When your project is a draft, you can contribute to it and the answers will be
stored in the database so you can have access to them, but no results will be
created. However, in the moment of publishing the project all the answers will
be flushed, so don't be afraid and try it as much as you can until you are sure
that everything works as expected.
Once you think the project is ready for the world to see it, just click 
in the Publish button:

|
.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/A7m4aa6.png
|

.. note::
    Publishing a project *cannot* be undone, so please double check everything
    before taking the step.

.. note::
    You can allow other users to give you feedback and let them try and see your
    project before it has been published. In order to do so, just protect it with
    a password, and people will be able to access it (as long as they have the
    password, of course).

After publishing it, you will be able to access your project using the slug, or
under your account in the *Published* projects section:

Also, results will begin to be created every time a task is completed. Enjoy!

Using the API
=============
Creating a project using the API involves also four steps:

    1. Create the project,
    2. Create the :ref:`task-creator`, and 
    3. Create the :ref:`task-presenter` for the users.
    4. Publish it. This needs to be done via the web interface. For more details please refer to :ref:`publishing`.

Creating the project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create a project via the API URL **/api/project** with a POST request (See
:ref:`api`).

You have to provide the following information about the project and convert
it to a JSON object (the actual values are taken from the `Flickr Person demo
project <http://github.com/PyBossa/app-flickrperson>`_)::

  name = u'Flickr Person Finder'
  short_name = u'FlickrPerson'
  description = u'Do you see a human in this photo?'
  info = { 'task_presenter': u'<div> Skeleton for the tasks</div>' }
  data = dict(name = name, short_name = short_name, description = description, info = info, hidden = 0)
  data = json.dumps(data)


Flickr Person Finder, which is a **demo template** that **you can re-use**
to create your own project, simplifies this step by using a simple
file named **project.json**:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "name": "Flickr Person Finder",
        "short_name": "flickrperson",
        "description": "Image pattern recognition",
    }


The file provides a basic configuration for your project. 


Adding tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~

As in all the previous steps, we are going to create a JSON
object and POST it using the following API URL **/api/task** in order to add
tasks to a project that you own. 

For PyBossa all the tasks are JSON objects with a field named **info** where
the owners of the project can add any JSON object that will represent
a task for their project. For example, using again the `Flickr Person demo project
<http://github.com/PyBossa/app-flickrperson>`_ example, we need to create a JSON object
that should have the link to the photo that we want to identify:

.. code-block:: python

    info = dict (link=photo['link'], 
                 url=photo['url_m'],
                 question='Do you see a human face in this photo?')
    data = dict (project_id=project_id,
                 state=0,
                 info=info,
                 calibration=0,
                 priority_0=0)
    data = json.dumps(data)

.. note::
    'url_m' is a pattern to describe the URL to the m medium size of the photo
    used by Flickr. It can be whatever you want, but as we are using Flickr we
    use the same patterns for storing the data.

The most important field for the task is the **info** one. This field will be
used to store a JSON object with the required data for the task. As  `Flickr Person
<https://github.com/PyBossa/app-flickrperson>`_ is trying to figure out if there is a human or
not in a photo, the provided information is:

    1. the Flickr web page posting the photo, and
    2. the direct URL to the image, the <img src> value.

The **info** field is a free-form field that can be populated with any
structure. If your project needs more fields, you can add them and use the
format that best fits your needs.

These steps are usually coded in the :ref:`task-creator`. The Flickr Person
Finder projects provides a template for the :ref:`task-creator` that can
be re-used without any problems. 

.. note::

    **The API request has to be authenticated and authorized**.
    You can get an API-KEY creating an account in the
    server, and checking the API-KEY created for your user, check the profile
    account (click in your user name) and copy the field **API-KEY**.

    This API-KEY should be passed as a POST argument like this with the
    previous data:

    [POST] http://domain/api/task/?api_key=API-KEY


One of the benefits of using the API is that you can create tasks polling other
web services like Flickr, where you can basically use an API. Once we have
created the tasks, we will need to create the :ref:`task-presenter` for the
project.


Creating the Task Presenter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`task-presenter` is usually a template of HTML and JavaScript that will present the
tasks to the users, and save the answers in the database. The `Flickr Person demo
project <http://github.com/PyBossa/app-flickersperson>`_ provides a simple template
which has a <div> to load the input files, in this case the photo, and another
<div> to load the action buttons that the users will be able to to press to
answer the question and save it in the database. Please, check the :doc:`tutorial` for more details
about the :ref:`task-presenter`.

As we will be using the API for creating the task presenter, we will basically
have to create an HTML file in our computer, read it from a script, and post 
it into PyBossa using the API.

Once the presenter has been posted to the project, you can edit it locally
with your own editor, or using the PyBossa interface (see previous section).

.. note::

    **The API request has to be authenticated and authorized**.
    You can get an API-KEY creating an account in the
    server, and checking the API-KEY created for your user, check the profile
    account (click in your user name) and copy the field **API-KEY**.

    This API-KEY should be passed as a POST argument like this with the
    previous data:

    [POST] http://domain/api/project/?api_key=API-KEY

We recommend to read the 
:doc:`Step by step tutorial on
creating a Project <tutorial>`, as you will understand
how to create the task presenter, which is basically adding some HTML skeleton
to load the task data, input fields to get the answer of the users, and some
JavaScript to make it work.

Using PyBossa API from the command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While you can use your own programming language to access the API we recommend
you to use the `PyBossa pbs command line tool
<https://github.com/PyBossa/pbs>`_ as it simpflies the usage of PyBossa for any
given project.

Creating a project is as simple as creating a project.json file and then run
the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   pbs --server server --api-key yourkey create_project 

Please, read the section :ref:`pbs` for more details.
