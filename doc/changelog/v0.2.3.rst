Changelog v0.2.3
================

The most interesting changes are the following:
 * New security version for POSTing task_runs preventing abusing the system
 * CKAN backend performance improvements: polling now with JavaScript
 * Themes support: now you can easily customize PyBossa look and feel
 * Breadth First Scheduler improved: now users can only participate once in
   every task.
 * Refactor API and add three new endpoints: globalstats, user and token.
 * Allow admins to download a list of users in CSV/JSON format.
 * Fix CKAN key uniqueness in DB.
 * Load 20 apps per page (customized in the settings page).

 * Use Markdown as default for App's long description field (with migration
   script for older versions).
 * Add a simple blog for each app where the owner can share its progress with
   the users.
 * Passwords in apps: the owner of the app can set a password so both anonymous
   and authenticated users are required to know it if they want to contribute to
   the app.
 * Background jobs: now PyBossa computes the statistics of projects in the
   background.
 * Audit log for projects: admin users can see the changes that a project has
   gone through.

   to a Mailchimp list.
